# Frontend guide

Big Cms revolves around [Yii2 themes](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-output-theming.html).


The frontend is controlled by the [backend](backend-guide.md) and this guide will as a result touch on the backend
as well as the frontend.


## Changing the layout of a page

In the backend navigate to "Templates" using the main menu. Here you can create and change the templates that renders each page. 
One template will be marked as default and cannot be deleted. 


For more information on themes and layouts read the [guide on themes](themes.md).


## Using a block

In the backend navigate to "Blocks" using the main menu. After Big Cms is installed 4 blocks are available:

  - **Contact** displays dynamic contact forms.
  - **Menu** displays bootstrap menus
  - **Pages categories** displays a list of pages within a category
  - **Text** displays content created with a TinyMCE editor.


## Developing a block

See the guide on [creating blocks](creating-blocks.md) for a tutorial on block development.
